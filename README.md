# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku Solver I built during my second year of university, for the Advanced Algorithms module.

Solves sudoku puzzles with an 'n' number of gaps. This application contains a set list of 400 sudoku puzzles, which increase in difficulty (number of gaps and number placement).

Once a puzzle is solved, the time taken (ms) is printed to the terminal.
